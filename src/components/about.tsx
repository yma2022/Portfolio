          I am Youlong Ma, a full-stack developer with a robust background in
          software engineering. Over the course of my career, I have tackled
          complex challenges and delivered innovative solutionsâ€”from building
          scalable applications to designing efficient system architectures. My
          expertise spans React Native, TypeScript, and AWS for frontend and
          cloud services, complemented by Go, PostgreSQL, and gRPC on the
          backend. I excel at optimizing performance in distributed systems and
          thrive on solving intricate technical problems.
